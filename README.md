Hong Kong Covid19 Latest Trend 1.0 - Casca Kwok

https://hkcbc.pythonanywhere.com/

A daily python tool I used to track every day the latest trend of covid 19 situation in Hong Kong.  

The original purpose of the tool, dating back to the beginning of pandemics (Mar 2020), was to track if I was in potential contact of virus during my 16 hours flight back to Hong Kong.

Hong Kong deploys zero case stragegy.  Therefore, source of inflection is tracked and flight information is released from data.gov.hk.  

Expect beginner codes here, but I like the idea of solving a real problem instead of √(−1) (imaging a case)!

Features
------------

- Track total number of Covid 19 cases of Hong Kong
- Display trends of  Covid 19 cases since the first case
- Get the official number at the end of the day, instead of inconsistent case number because of early release of numbers in different public annoucement
- Track flight number, date of department, number of in flight confirmed case, to provide information for a passenger if they are in concern of contacting virus after taking a flight


Roadmap Features
---------------------------------
- Predicts potential of flight suspension mechanism by calculating 4 weeks in flight confirmed number

Note
------------
The code is updated on 6 Feb 2022, in response to updated API format from data.gov.hk
